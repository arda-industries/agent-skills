### Video Resources (REQUIRED)
Find YouTube videos showing this product. **Prioritize videos with substantial product demos** over marketing content.

**STRONGLY PREFERRED (hands-on demos):**
- Tutorial/walkthrough videos showing step-by-step workflows (10-30 min ideal)
- User/consultant videos demonstrating real-world usage
- Conference sessions with live product demonstrations
- Third-party reviews with extended screen recordings
- "Getting started" or training videos

**LESS USEFUL (marketing content):**
- Short announcement/intro videos (<3 min)
- Videos that are mostly animations, graphics, or talking heads
- Webinars that are primarily slides with brief UI glimpses
- Testimonial videos where customers describe benefits without showing the product

For each video found, provide:
- **Title**: Full video title
- **URL**: Complete YouTube URL (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...)
- **Duration**: Approximate length
- **Type**: Demo/Tutorial/Review/Interview/Marketing
- **Demo Quality**: HIGH (extended hands-on UI walkthrough), MEDIUM (some UI shown), LOW (mostly talking/slides/animations)
- **Content**: 1-2 sentence description of what the video actually shows

List 5-8 videos if available. Rank by demo quality (HIGH first), then by duration (longer = more depth).

**Example of a HIGH demo quality video:**
> "Teamcenter Tutorial: Managing BOMs" (25 min) - Instructor walks through creating and modifying bills of materials, showing each UI step in detail.

**Example of a LOW demo quality video:**
> "Introducing Teamcenter X" (3 min) - Animated overview of product vision with brief UI clips, no workflow detail.

### Recommendations (max 4 bullets)

5. **User sentiment**: Real reviews and feedback
